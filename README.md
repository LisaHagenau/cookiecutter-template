# cookiecutter-template
A custom cookiecutter template for my bioinfo projects

### Prerequisites
cookiecutter...obviously. [Installation instructions here](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
### How to use
To generate a new project, simply run

```cookiecutter https://github.com/LisaHagenau/cookiecutter-template```

## Project structure
This is the folder structure generated by the template:

```
./{{cookiecutter.directory_name}}/
|-- AUTHORS.md          <- names of people working on the project
|-- README.md           <- this file, explains what goes where and additional, project-specific information, e.g.prerequisites and how-to-use
|-- config              <- configuration files for software, if needed
|-- data                
|   |-- external        <- not your own data
|   |-- interim         <- intermediate data produced by analysis, can safely be deleted
|   |-- metadata        <- description of raw files goes here
|   |-- processed       <- final data used for the analysis, e.g. bam or variant files
|   |-- raw             <- raw data, read-only!
|-- docs                <- everything that doesn't belong in references or reports
