|-- README.md		<- this file, explains what goes where and contains additional, project-specific information
|-- config           	<- configuration files for software, if needed
|-- data		
|   |-- external	<- not your own data
|   |-- interim		<- intermediate data produced by analysis, can safely be deleted
|   |-- metadata	<- description of raw files goes here
|   |-- processed	<- final data used for the analysis, e.g. bam or variant files
|   |-- raw		<- raw data, read-only!
|-- docs		<- everything that doesn't belong in references or reports
|-- enviroment.yml	<- conda environment file
|-- logs		<- log output from software goes here, create new subdirectories if needed
|-- references		<- software manuals, literature 
|-- reports		<- annotated results in article or pdf form (e.g. R Notebooks or Markdown documents)
|   |-- figures		<- extra directory for figures
|-- src			<- project source code: bash, python or R scripts
