### How to use
This is a custom cookiecutter template for bioinformatic projects. 
To generate a new project:

1. go to project folder (no need to make a new folder for the project)

2. ```cookiecutter ~/cookiecutter_test/customcookie```

3. input project name and data by following the prompt

## Project structure
This is the folder structure generated by the template:

```
./{{cookiecutter.directory_name}}/
|-- AUTHORS.md		<- names of people working on the project
|-- README.md		<- this file, explains what goes where and contains additional, project-specific information
|-- config           	<- configuration files for software, if needed
|-- data		
|   |-- external	<- data from third party sources
|   |-- interim		<- intermediate data produced by analysis, can safely be deleted
|   |-- metadata	<- description of raw files goes here
|   |-- processed	<- final data used for the analysis, e.g. bam or variant files
|   |-- raw		<- raw data, read-only!
|-- docs		<- everything that doesn't belong in references or reports
|-- enviroment.yml	<- conda environment file
|-- logs		<- log output from software goes here, create new subdirectories if needed
|-- references		<- manuals, literature 
|-- reports		<- annotated results in article or pdf form (e.g. R Notebooks or Markdown documents)
|   |-- figures		<- extra directory for figures
|-- src			<- project source code: bash, python or R scripts
```

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Explain what is needed to run the analysis, e.g. which software/conda environment. 

### Installing
